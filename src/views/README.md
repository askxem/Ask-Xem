# views

Our last folder is the `views` folder. The pages that we render on our websites are generally composed of many different individual components. The individual components that live in our `components` folder are used on these pages together to build our UI.

Think of a Home page in your app. The `Home.jsx` page would represent this page. The `Home.jsx` page will be comprised of many smaller components together. Each individual page in your app and the individual components needed to create that page will be in the views folder.
