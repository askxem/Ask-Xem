# utils

Our utils folder is the rest of the files in your toolbox that will make your components run more smoothly. Our small utility functions that perform a specific unit of work will live here. Capitalizing words, fixing URLs, or transforming data. These types of functions will live here.

Also, files that establish a connection to your database or some other source and maintain a connection can also be established here in the `utils` folder.
